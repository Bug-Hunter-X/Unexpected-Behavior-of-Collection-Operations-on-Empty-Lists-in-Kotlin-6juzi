This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error in Kotlin related to collection operations on empty lists.  Specifically, the `map` and `filter` operations on empty lists return an empty list without exceptions. While this is technically correct, it can lead to unexpected behavior if not accounted for, particularly when the result is used in subsequent computations or assertions expecting a certain non-empty output.  The `EmptyListOperations.kt` file shows the issue, while `EmptyListOperationsSolution.kt` provides possible approaches to handle such cases to avoid issues in production code.
